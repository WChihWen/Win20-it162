<h1>What Languages are Used for Development?</h1>
<section>
  <p class="padding">
      Although there are a variety of programming languages for software development, we can simply classify them.
      They are Front End Language and Back End Language. 
      Front end programming languages is to create what the user sees in a browser; Back end programming languages is to fulfill those requests on the server side. Combined, it creates a seamless experience for the user.
      <br><br>
      So I list a few commonly used programming languages below.
