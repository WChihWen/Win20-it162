        Due to the advancement of mobile devices technology and connection to the Internet, people are starting to look for information needed, play games, and do their work on their mobile devices. Users will ask developers to build a version on mobile devices because theyâ€™d like to look for information, play games, and do their work immediately. Therefore, we can predict that more and more applications or websites will be on mobile devices, and they have their own advantages between responsive websites and mobile apps.
    </p>

    <h3>Advantages of responsive websites:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They provide a flexible layout that can respond to any size of the screen.</li>
        <li>All updates are made on one server.</li>
        <li>Users can reach the websites without installing any application. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Advantages of mobile apps:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They have a reminder notification function.</li>
        <li>They do not require internet connections to function.</li>
        <li>They can store essential data on devices and do not rely on a web browser to perform even the most elementary functions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    To sum up, people would have the question which is the best. The answers are on above. If the functions are defined looking for information, the responsive websites are better than mobile apps because of less cost. On the other hand, if we need good performance, such as playing games or doing work, mobile apps are better than responsive websites.
